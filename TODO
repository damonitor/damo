- Test --numa_node 0 case
- Implement histogram stat regions output
- damo show features implementation
  - support target damos filter
  - time based filtering
  - collapse by time
  - collapse by priority value (more histogram control)
    - --histogram hotness?
  - Implement min/max snapshot format keyword
- damo reclaim: add a command for basic investigation
  - helps ensure DAMON_RECLAIM is working as expected
  - helps reporting issue
- Handle _damon_sysfs file i/o error for unsupported kernel features and
  conflicts with concurrent ones
- Optimize 'replay' performance
  - An approach for 2 MiB-granularity page management didn't show improvement
  - Optionally use C program like 'masim'
- Let 'replay' further parse vmas and alloc/release memory
- Unify wss and footprints report types
- Fixup 'damo show' on schemes_tried_regions unsupported kernels
  - Either make the warning clear, or support it using trace points
  - (https://github.com/awslabs/damo/issues/101)

- Show temperature histogram on holistic report
- heatmap: Support interactive zoom in/out/scrolling
- Implement single report formatter
  - Extend 'report access' format arguments for wss, memfootprint, etc
- Provide virtual memory mapping information
  - shows when what virtual address has mappend and unmapped
- Implement an official feature to check if 'damo' supports the system
  - 'damo diagnose --kernel_support'?  Or, 'damo report damon --kernel_support'?
