- Test --numa_node 0 case
- damo show features implementation
  - collapse by time
  - Implement min/max snapshot format keyword
- damo reclaim: add a command for basic investigation
  - helps ensure DAMON_RECLAIM is working as expected
  - helps reporting issue
- Handle _damon_sysfs file i/o error for unsupported kernel features and
  conflicts with concurrent ones
- Optimize 'replay' performance
  - An approach for 2 MiB-granularity page management didn't show improvement
  - Optionally use C program like 'masim'
- Let 'replay' further parse vmas and alloc/release memory
- Unify wss and footprints report types
- Fixup 'damo show' on schemes_tried_regions unsupported kernels
  - Either make the warning clear, or support it using trace points
  - (https://github.com/awslabs/damo/issues/101)
- 'diagnose' command
  - check if nr_regions in bound
  - check if DAMOS quota is in control
- 'damo monitor'
  - add option to add snapshot as (optional) alternate of heatmap
- Show temperature histogram on holistic report
- heatmap: Support interactive zoom in/out/scrolling
- Implement single report formatter
  - Extend 'report access' format arguments for wss, memfootprint, etc
- Provide virtual memory mapping information
  - shows when what virtual address has mappend and unmapped
- Implement an official feature to check if 'damo' supports the system
  - 'damo diagnose --kernel_support'?  Or, 'damo report damon --kernel_support'?
- Automatically translate single allow filter to reject filter
  - Pending.  Just warning might be sufficient.
- Show intervals auto-tuning status on 'report access'
  - If the tuning is activated, show positive sample rate and current tuned intervals
- Update tuned intervals when getting snapshot, for only intervals auto-tuning
  enabled contexts
- Warn or error recording when intervals auto-tuning enabled.
  - Disabling auto-tuning is another option.
- damo report access: show '<access observation ratio>' by default if
  auto-tuning ongoing
- do not update monitoring intervals when doing snapshot
  - reverting auto-tuned intervals, so make it not well working...
  - Even when a monitoring scheme is installed, effectively_same() returns
    False due to auto-tuned interval.
  - Works without committing intervals again, only if --tried_regions_of is
    given.
- make 'damo report heatmap' better
  - provide three regions heatmap by default, or notice their existence
  - better document the hidden regions
